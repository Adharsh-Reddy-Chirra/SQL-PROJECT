A# 🛒 Amazon-like Inventory Database Model

This repository showcases a fully structured **Inventory Management Database Model** inspired by Amazon’s backend systems. It demonstrates how relational databases can efficiently support product listings, inventory tracking, supplier management, and order workflows in large-scale e-commerce platforms.

## 📦 Features

- **🔧 SQL Code**: Well-structured SQL scripts for creating the full database schema — including tables, relationships, constraints, and indexes.
- **📄 Documentation**: Clear, step-by-step explanations of database logic, table structures, and system use cases.
- **🗺️ ERD Diagrams**: Professionally designed Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to visually explain the database relationships and architecture.

## 📂 What's Included

### 📜 SQL Scripts
- Full SQL script to create the inventory database schema.
- Includes `CREATE TABLE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, and other constraints.
- Covers entities like products, categories, suppliers, inventory, orders, and order items.

### 📘 Documentation
- Descriptions of each table and its role in the system.
- Explanation of relationships and how they mirror real-world e-commerce inventory systems.
- Use cases and practical scenarios of how this schema could be implemented in a production environment.

### 🧩 ERD Diagrams
- High-resolution ERD image(s) included for quick visual reference.
- Helps in understanding table relationships, foreign keys, and schema flow.


## 💡 Use Cases

- Educational reference for database modeling in e-commerce.
- Starting point for building real-world inventory or order management systems.
- Practice resource for SQL learners, developers, and database architects.
